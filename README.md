# Orchard ![](http://ermakovich.github.com/orchard-responsive-theme-machine/index_files/orchard.ico) Responsive Theme Machine ([Demo](http://ermakovich.github.com/orchard-responsive-theme-machine/))

Orchard default theme with a "mobile-first" responsive design.
It's aimed on providing an equal user experience for different viewport sizes.

The idea of this project is inspired mainly by the [HTML5 Boilerplate Project](http://h5bp.com/).

### Layout modes, that are currently implemented

* Viewport `width < 960px` (default "mobile-first");
* Viewport `width >= 960px` (wide viewport);

More layout modes will be added in order to provide better user experience.

### Features, that are actually inherited from the H5BP project

* HTML5 ready. Use the new elements with confidence.
* Cross-browser compatible (Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox 3.6+, IE6+).
* Designed with progressive enhancement in mind.
* Includes [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) for CSS
  normalizations and common bug fixes.
* The latest [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) build for feature detection.
* IE-specific classes for easier cross-browser control.
* Placeholder CSS Media Queries.
* Protection against any stray `console.log` causing JavaScript errors in
  IE6/7.
